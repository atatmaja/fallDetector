# Fall Detector
Top 5 and winner of the Wolfram Challenge at Enghack 2018!

## Inspiration
Falling injuries affect many elderly people and it is necessary to be able to respond to their emergencies. Our app serves to notify caretakers of falling injuries and guide first responders to their location.

## What it does
Our app essentially takes data from a phone's accelerometer and uses the returned data to determine is the movement indeed qualifies as a fall. With the returned data, one can also obtain the location of the person in need and find their position on a map.

This app was built by Austin Atmaja, Charlie Lew, David Zhang, Ethan Lee and Manthan Shah. Find our submission [here](https://devpost.com/software/fall-finder).
